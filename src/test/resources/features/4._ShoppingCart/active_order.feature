#Business Need: Search products by name, brand or sku
#  In order to sell more products
#  As a digital product manager
#  I want users to be able to find and see the detail of their products that best suits their needs

#  Rule: search for valid product names, brands or skus
#    @Current
#    Example: users can search products by name or brand
#      Given Alexander is a frequent customer and wants to search products
#      When he tries to search by name or brand
#      Then he should see all the results for the matching products

##  Scenario: test 1
##  Failure:Joe is showing as a high-risk customer
##    Given Clive has made a purchase
##    When he reviews his past orders
